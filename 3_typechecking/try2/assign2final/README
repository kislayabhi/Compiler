Solution may have problem. feel free to email me if you find it. 

There are some common problems & announcement: 
(1)array index: 
	in declaration: int x[CONST-expr], i.e. int x[1+2]
	Different case is "RETURN expr ;"

(2)function declaration is not required. So, test14.c is not counted. 
	Structure declaration is needed. 

(3)typedef:
	Sorry, at first time I sent an incorrect massage about that. 
	TYPEDEF is different with #define ("emails I said little different"). So directly replace "type" and "newname" is not a correct way to handle it. 

	Here is webpage:
http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/254473/in-which-stage-of-compilation-is-typedef-resolved-by-the-compiler
	And here are some examples about TYPEDEF: 
	a) typedef int size; /* basic: (size) = (int) */
	b) typedef int size[10]; /* "size x" is same with "int x[10]" */
	c) typedef struct Student
		{ int a;
		}Stu; /* "Stu" is same with "struct Student"  */
		      /* so, "Stu Paul" is same with "struct Student Paul" */	

	d) typedef struct{...}Stu /* bec Stu is newname, old name can be omitted */

	e) typedef struct{int n;}aaa,bbb,ccc;
		/* old name omitted, newname are aaa,bbb,ccc */
		/* typedef struct{int n;}aaa; typedef aaa bbb; typedef aaa ccc; */

	I will check with professor about which case you need to cover, but basic usage is required. And the webpage shows hints for how to handle it. 

(4) Some of you have IF-ELSE problem. 
	I think the reason is: if IF-stmt only have one stmt in the block, "{""}" is not needed. FOR loop has same situation. /*if(x==1) y=1;*/
	FOR loop's three expression (for(expr1;expr2;expr3)) should be same expression "type". It's not right saying: expr1 and expr3 are calculation expr, expr2 is condition expr. 

(4) Some of you has an error at test21.c, I mean something like "3 = x; "


That's all. Thanks,
Minjun

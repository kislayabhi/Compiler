Extra Work.

1. Every Assignment is checked against the type of LHS and the RHS.

At the time of return, i am handling the function calls also
Also if a function is declared in the parameter list, I am taking care of it
when it is used in the function body.

The parameter list at the time of declaration should the match the expressions provided at the time
of calling the function.

int a;
a=0.5 /*This produces error in my code but not in the original one*/

For a function declared void, there is no need of a return statement as it is implicit. This is not
taken care in the provided solution by you. I have included that in my grammar and this can be checked
via xxxx.c

TODO: I am still not taking care of the fact that in a function a[1][2], even a[1] would work in the current case.
I am sorry for this. Getting this work means 2 hours more effort. I will move onto next rule now.
